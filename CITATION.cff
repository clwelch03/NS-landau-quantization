abstract: >-
  Some neutron stars known as magnetars possess very strong
  magnetic fields, with surface fields as large as 10^15 G
  and internal fields that are possibly stronger. Recent
  observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627 suggest it
  may have a surface field as strong as 10^16 G. In the
  presence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of
  electrons and protons are quantized and the Direct Urca
  process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly, even at low
  density. For the case of magnetic fields Bâ‰¥1016G, we find
  features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that
  are not captured by the frequently employed quasiclassical
  approximation where energy levels are treated as nearly
  continuous. Resonances can result in amplification of the
  neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a
  calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at
  low temperature. These effects are not important for the
  thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be
  relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific
  densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of
  the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the
  standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field
  nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical
  challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new
  semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also
  applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong
  magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star
  mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos
  capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and
  temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to
  capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an
  order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron
  Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and
  from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the
  case of capture on protons.
